This directory contains
a few "interesting" queries
for the Marabou verifier.
These queries require 
changing the source code of Marabou;
I have explained the details
in the top-level README.

The `loadsolve` module comes in handy
when you want to run a single query:
```bash
python -m loadsolve /path/to/query
```
