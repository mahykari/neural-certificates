This directory contains drafts 
for learning stochastic reach-avoid certificates.
The same scripts can be found at [1],
which is a branch on my fork of Mathias' code (at [2]).
`.jax` files contain the parameters of trained controllers;
they can also be found at [2],
in the `checkpoints/` directory.
