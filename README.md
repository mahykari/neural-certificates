# Neural Certificates

A prototype learner-verifier for dynamical systems. 

# Cautions for using this repository

Most of the code here is written experimentally;
some modules are stale, and will not work.
Some modules are duplicates of other modules.
My _suggestion_ is to look at the drafts;
at commit 
[a1830c1](https://github.com/mahykari/neural-certificates/tree/a1830c1f75d4e77e7f987b30f18aa73c801c96e1),
all drafts work.
